## bugs
- [x] text from the orientation lines is not deleting
- [ ] fix the cursor interaction to work globally and treat exiting box as mouse up
- [ ] when changing layers, change the mode to draw
- [ ] select does not work on perfectly vertical and horizontal lines
- [ ] history stack exists but does not work too well
## todo
- [x] get the selection hooked to the double click
- [x] make exceptions for the orientation lines
- [x] implement select delete
- [x] get a length working for the orientation line
- [ ] naming files
- [x] load from thumbnails
- [x] make layers with thumbnails
- [x] convert draw select to sidebar icons
- [x] add select to points level
- [ ] brainstorm connections interface
- [ ] have move points on when drawing on outline and orientation lines
- [ ] some graphical indicator of orientation lines direction clicking
- [ ] make it impossible to draw orientation lines in the border 
- [ ] add labels to orient lines (gated)
- [ ] make the assembler take null
- [ ] orientation lines only work in one direction, make sure that is clear 
- [ ] move clear layer to be outside the selection area for the layer => make an edit layer button inside the layer 
- [ ] make text subordinate to a point on a Line Object to ensure that delete takes care of both and that we don't need to handle these individually
## todo big
- [ ] make a global file system
- [x] enable a history stack
- [x] make the point system consistent across the assembler and the drawing 
- [x] refactor in general
- [ ] line smoothing function to reduce lag time + allow control point moving => change the point type to include control points
